If we are getting weird bugs, we can use AddressSanitizer to see if it's something we're doing that's hard to spot.

To use it, add -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer to compilation flags, and then run the executable.

For symbols (function names), we need to set the path to a symboliser.

On Linux, this is requires installing LLVM and thus we would run:

ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer ./build_x86/launch-SECRET_PROJECT.sh

(Note that the path to the symboliser could differ from the above.)
